Tailored T-Shirt Shop - With Cart Functionality

The Iron Yard - Week 2, Day 3

The purpose of this assignment was to gain experience working with JavaScript and selecting HTML elements using JavaScripts' DOM selectors. For this assignment we were to add cart functionality to the previous Tailored T-Shirt Shop project by utilizing vanilla JavaScript. 

The cart is hidden when no items are in it. As soon as an item is placed in the cart it appears fixed in the bottom right corner of the screen. The cart displays each cart item's title and price, as well as the carts total, tax, and amount due.
